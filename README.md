# Simple-VideoChat-App
 Simple video chat app made with JavaScript, NodeJS and Agora API. 

You will need to register a profile at https://www.agora.io.

1. Run "npm install" in the main directory.
2. (Assuming you already have an agora.io profile) Open .env file and add your AGORA CHANNEL_NAME,APP_ID and APP_CERTIFICATE details so that main.js can function properly and TokenGenerator can generate each user an AGORA token in order for them to be able to join your voice channel.
3. Go inside TokenGenerator directory and run "npm start" to start the server.
4. Open index.html, click join and you are done.
